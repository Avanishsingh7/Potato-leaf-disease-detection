# Potato Disease Detection Model

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model for detecting diseases in potato plants using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model takes images of potato plants and classifies them into different disease categories, helping farmers and agricultural professionals in early detection and management.

## Features
- CNN-based image classification model for detecting potato plant diseases.
- Preprocessing and augmentation techniques to improve model accuracy.
- Visualization of results for better interpretability.

## Requirements
To run the model, you need the following Python libraries:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (for image processing)
  
You can install the dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Open the Disease_detection.ipynb notebook in Jupyter.
Follow the steps in the notebook to load the potato plant images and run the model to detect diseases.
The model classifies images into disease categories and provides accuracy metrics for the evaluation.
Dataset
The model uses a dataset of potato plant images labeled with different diseases. Make sure to download the dataset and place it in the appropriate folder, or use your custom dataset for testing.

Model Details
Model Type: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Framework: TensorFlow/Keras
Data Augmentation: Applied to enhance the generalization of the model.
Accuracy: The modelâ€™s accuracy and loss during training and evaluation are displayed to help fine-tune its performance.
